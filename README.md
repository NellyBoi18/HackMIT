Welcome to our 2022 HackMIT submission! Our main goal was to produce a program which would run analytics on data to reduce food waste in restaurants. Customers would input their montly invoice/inventory, the receipes or meals they make, and the meals which were sold for the month. This program will output the monthly excess for each given product so as to reduce the amount of food thrown out. This vizualisation would update each month to increase the value for the customer in a more accurate result of ingredient usage over n months.
